Genvira was spun out of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in 2019 by Dr. Jiahu Wang with a clear vision: to unlock the full potential of viral engineering for the next generation of therapies and vaccines.
What began as a research-driven idea --- creating more stable, efficient, and customizable viral vectors --- quickly evolved into a company focused solving some of the most pressing challenges in gene and cell therapy manufacturing.

From our early days, we recognized that traditional viral vector platforms struggled with genetic stability, low yields, and limited payload capacity.
These bottlenecks slowed down innovation and kept many promising treatments from reaching patients.
Genvira was created to change that.

Starting with a team of scientists and engineers passionate about both biology and translational medicine, we built a platform for **designing, constructing, and validating viral vectors** with greater precision and reliability.

Over time, our work expanded to partnerships with biotech innovators, academic groups, and industry collaborators, helping them bring novel therapies closer to the clinic.

Today, Genvira continues to push the boundaries of viral engineering --- develooping vectors tailored for cancer immunotherapy, genetic medicines, and vaccines.
What began as a bold idea has grown into a mission: **to enable safer, scalable, and more effective therapies through smarter viral vector design**
