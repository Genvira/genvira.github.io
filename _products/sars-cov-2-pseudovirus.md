SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses are safe and valuable research tools. Genvira’s pseudoviruses are available with different combinations of reporter gene-like green fluorescent protein (GFP), luciferase (firefly and renilla) gene and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain and Omicron variants BA.4/.5). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) based pseudovirus is more sensitive (brighter) and can produce reporter faster. Our high quality pseudoviruses (with reporter GFP and Luciferase) are suitable for head-to-head comparison and in vitro and in vivo studies.

Omicron variants BA.4/.5 strain used contain few mutations as compared to WH strain surface glycoprotein: S1 domain: T19I, deletion (Δ)L24-P26, A27S, ΔH69+V70, G142D, V213G, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H RBD: G339D, S371F, S373P, S375F, T376A, D405N, R408S, K417N, N440K, L452R, S477N, T478K, E484A, F486V, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H S1/S2 boundary: Functional furin cleavage site S2 domain: N764K, D796Y, Q954H, N969K.
For WH Spike, full S or full S with C-9 tag at the C-terminus for easy detection.
